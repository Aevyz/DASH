# Routing guidelines

This article explains the basic steps to build a **routing table** and how to
use **mappings** during the process.  
It is important to notice from the get go, **routing** and **mapping** are two
different but complementary concepts, specifically:

1. **Routing**. It is used by the customer to configure the way the traffic must
be routed. It must be clear that routing table has the last say in the way the
traffic is routed. For example, by defaut usually this entry applies:

    `0/0 -> Internet (Default)`

    But the customer can override the entry and route the traffic as follows:

    `8.8.0.0/16 -> Internet (SNAT to VIP)`

    `0/0 -> Default Hop: 10.1.2.11 (Firewall in current VNET)`

1. **Mapping**. It allows to relate the customerâ€™s defined routing to the
   network physical space that is transparent to the customer . In other words,
   mapping allows to know what is the **physical address** (PA) for a specific
   **customer address** (CA) and if it requires different encap, etc.
1. On the other hand, we want to be able to plumb (insert) in the routing table
   for an entry a specific mapping, for example:  

    `10.3.0.0/16 -> VNET C (Peered) (use mapping)`
